Makefile controls the desired step. Makefile actually invokes dedicated shell script.

File clean up

Xcelium logic simulator is currently set up for simulation as sepaerate licenses and instalation as prerequisites are needed.
Currently there are no automatic checks implemented thus correct behaviour is confirmed by visual inspection of the waveforms. 


For syntehsis (only):
--------------------------

In order to run synthesis navigate to exact folder where this README is located and execute: 'make synth'. Separate .sh script is invoked performing simulation tool invocation.
